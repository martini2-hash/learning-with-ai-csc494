# Learning with AI – CSC 494

## Overview
This repository documents my learning process using AI tools for my project, **Mold Risk Monitor**, in the AI-Driven IoT System Development course.

The goal is to use AI as a learning assistant to understand both hardware and software concepts required to build an IoT system.

## Learning Goals

I selected two main topics to learn with AI:

### 1. Hardware Topic – I2C Communication

#### What I Am Learning
- How I2C communication works between microcontrollers and sensors  
- How to connect and communicate with the AHT10 sensor  
- Understanding SDA and SCL connections  
- Reading and interpreting sensor data  

#### Why This Is Important
I2C communication is essential for connecting sensors in IoT systems. 
My project relies on collecting temperature and humidity data, which requires reliable communication between the ESP32 and the sensor.

#### How I Use AI
- Ask AI to explain I2C communication in simple terms  
- Get help debugging wiring and connection issues  
- Understand sensor datasheets and libraries  
- Troubleshoot when the sensor is not detected

### 2. Software Topic – Web Application Development

#### What I Am Learning
- How to build a simple web dashboard  
- How to display temperature and humidity data  
- How to visualize trends over time  
- Basics of frontend frameworks and data visualization  

#### Why This Is Important
My project focuses on recognizing mold risk through environmental patterns over time. A web application will help visualize this data and make it easier for users to understand.

#### How I Use AI
- Ask AI to suggest tools and frameworks  
- Learn how to structure a web application  
- Get help writing code for data visualization  
- Understand how to connect IoT data to a web interface

## Reflection

Using AI has helped me:
- Learn new technical concepts faster  
- Debug both hardware and software issues  
- Understand how different components work together  
- Build confidence in working with IoT systems  

AI acts as a guide that helps me move from not knowing where to start to successfully building a working system.

## Next Steps

- Learn how to send data from ESP32 to a web application  
- Build a dashboard to visualize environmental data  
- Explore ways to highlight high humidity conditions
